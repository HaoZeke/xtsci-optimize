/-! # The trust radius cannot lie

`src/trust.rs::update_radius` and the outer loop of
`src/hvp.rs::minimize_newton_cg` manage one number, the trust radius,
and the solver's honesty rests on three properties of that number: it
stays positive, it never exceeds the cap the caller set, and repeated
model failures drive it to the floor geometrically -- at which point
the code reports `TrustCollapsed` instead of pretending convergence.
