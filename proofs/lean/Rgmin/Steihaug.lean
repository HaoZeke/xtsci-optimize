/-! # The Steihaug boundary step

`src/hvp.rs::steihaug_cg` follows a conjugate-gradient direction until
one of three things happens: the residual is small, the curvature along
the direction fails to be positive, or the iterate would leave the
trust region. In the last two cases the code walks to the boundary
along the current direction, with the step length `tau` from
`boundary_tau`: the positive root of the quadratic
`dd * tau^2 + 2 * zd * tau + (zz - r^2) = 0`.

Two facts carry the whole construction: the root lands exactly on the
sphere, and it never walks backwards. The negative-curvature case adds
the third: pushing further along a non-positive-curvature descent
direction only lowers the model, so stopping at the boundary is the
right amount of greed.

/-- **The boundary root lands on the sphere.** With a nonnegative
discriminant and a nonzero direction mass, the returned `tau`
satisfies the crossing quadratic exactly:
`||z + tau d||^2 = r^2` in whichever inner product the caller tracked

/-- **The boundary step never walks backwards.** Inside the region
(`zz ≤ r^2`) with positive direction mass, the discriminant dominates
`zd^2`, so its square root is at least `|zd|` and the numerator
`-zd + sqrt(disc)` cannot be negative. A boundary exit always extends
the current step. -/

/-- **Under non-positive curvature, further is never worse.** Along a
descent direction (`gd ≤ 0`) with `dHd ≤ 0`, the ray model is
monotonically nonincreasing in the step, so the largest feasible step
-- the trust boundary -- minimizes the model on the ray. This is why
`steihaug_cg` treats negative curvature as licence to walk straight to
the sphere. -/
