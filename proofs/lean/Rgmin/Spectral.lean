/-! # The sketch cannot manufacture negative curvature

`src/hvp.rs::NystromPrecond` builds its low-rank factor as `B` with
`A_nys = B * B^T`, then shifts by the smallest kept eigenvalue. The
preconditioner is only legitimate if that construction is positive
semidefinite: an indefinite `M` would corrupt the CG inner products
and the "randomness only in the sketch" claim with them.

`B B^T` is a Gram matrix, and Gram matrices are positive semidefinite
-- here as the actual matrix theorem, not a scalar stand-in. The
weight lemmas then pin the solve: with a nonnegative captured
spectrum and a positive shift, every divisor is positive and every
damping factor sits in `(0, 1]`.

/-- **The Nystrom factor is positive semidefinite, whatever the random
draw produced.** `B * Bᴴ` is a Gram matrix; over the reals the
conjugate transpose is the transpose, so this is exactly the
`A_nys = B B^T` the code assembles. No sketch, however unlucky, can
hand CG an indefinite preconditioner. -/

captured mode `i` by `mu / (lam_i + mu)`; with `lam_i ≥ 0` and
`mu > 0` the weight sits in `(0, 1]`, so the preconditioner's action
on the sketched subspace is a contraction and no component ever flips
sign. -/
