* About
#+begin_quote
This has no official relationship to either ~xtensor~ or ~scipy~!!!
#+end_quote

Part of the larger ~xtsci~ project, which iteratively implements parts of
~scipy~ using ~xtensor~ and modern C++ based on my needs. At some point (or with
funding) this might cover all of ~scipy~, but its really more of a rapid
prototyping thing.

** Usage
Until bindings are ready, ~tiny_cli.cpp~ can be edited and run with output piped
to get a visual for the Rosenbrock function.

#+begin_src bash
meson setup bbdir
meson compile -C bbdir
./bbdir/CppCore/tiny_cli > output.txt
python scripts/plot_cpp.py
#+end_src

** Components
The heart of the library is the ~xts~ namespace, with functions further
demarcated according to the relevant ~scipy~ modules e.g.
~xts::optimize~.

** Provenance
These are constructed mostly with the notation of the Nocedal and Wright book.

** License
