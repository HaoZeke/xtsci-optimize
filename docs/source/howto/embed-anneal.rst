Embed in anneal
---------------

Hopping chains in `anneal <https://github.com/HaoZeke/anneal>`_ relax thousands of times from perturbations of
an already-relaxed structure. They do not own a second L-BFGS: they hold
an ``rgmin::Lbfgs`` through ``anneal_core::methods::warm_lbfgs::WarmLbfgs``.

      eindir/
      rgmin/
      anneal/
      landfold/

``anneal`` and ``landfold`` path-depend on the two siblings so there is one
``eindir-core`` and one ``rgmin`` in the graph.

The public hopping API is unchanged:

.. code:: rust

    use anneal_core::methods::warm_lbfgs::WarmLbfgs;
    use ndarray::Array1;

    let mut opt = WarmLbfgs::default();
    let x0 = Array1::from(vec![1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]);
    let (f, x, evals) = opt.minimize(x0.view(), 200, |v| Some(fg(v)));

``WarmLbfgs::forget`` drops the pair history when the chain jumps to a
structurally different basin. ``minimize_watched`` still sits at the top of
each accepted iterate so a screening predictor can stop the relaxation.

Why this crate, not a copy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A second two-loop in anneal drifted from the Nocedal-Wright 7.20 scale
once already. The production method, the line search, and the pair
history belong in one place.
