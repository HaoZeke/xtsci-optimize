Doxygen with doxyYoda
---------------------

The C and C++ hourglass is documented by Doxygen and themed with
`doxyYoda <https://github.com/HaoZeke/doxyYoda>`_ 0.2.2.

Fetch the theme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    scripts/get_doxyyoda.sh

This extracts the release tarball into ``docs/doxyYoda/`` (gitignored).

Build the HTML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    cd docs/source
    doxygen Doxyfile_doxyyoda.cfg

Output lands in ``docs/doxygen-html/html/``. The Doxyfile points at

- ``docs/doxyYoda/html/header.html``

- ``docs/doxyYoda/html/footer.html``

- ``docs/doxyYoda/css/doxyYoda.min.css``

- ``docs/doxyYoda/xml/doxyYoda.xml``

What is extracted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``INPUT`` is the public hourglass: ``include/xts.h``, ``include/xts/*.hpp``,
and ``docs/source/mainpage.dox``. Rust rustdoc stays on ``cargo doc``.
The orgmode book in ``docs/orgmode/`` is the narrative layer.
