=======================================
Trust regions and the Steihaug boundary
=======================================


.. contents::

Line searches commit to a direction and haggle over the length. Trust
regions invert the deal: fix a budget on the length, then ask for the
best step the local model affords inside it. This page derives the
machinery behind ``src/trust.rs`` (dense dogleg) and ``src/hvp.rs``
(matrix-free Steihaug-Toint), and names the exact rational facts the
Lean proofs pin.

1 The model and the ratio
-------------------------

Around the current point the quadratic model is

m(p) = f + g . p + (1/2) p . H p,

trusted only within ||p|| <= Delta. After solving the subproblem
approximately for a step ``p``, the honesty check compares the actual
reduction to the predicted one:

rho = (f - f(x + p)) / (m(0) - m(p)).

The radius update (Nocedal-Wright algorithm 4.1, ``update_radius``)
shrinks by four when rho < 1/4, doubles (capped) when rho > 3/4 and
the step pressed the boundary, and otherwise holds. Three properties
make this loop honest, each proved in
`proofs/lean/Rgmin/Trust.lean <../../../proofs/lean/Rgmin/Trust.lean>`_:

- ``shrink_ge_floor`` / ``shrink_pos``: the radius never leaves the
  positive floor, so no division or comparison downstream degenerates.

- ``shrink_strict`` and the ``collapse`` recursion: consecutive failures
  decay the radius geometrically (one factor of four per rejection),
  so the loop must either accept a step or hit the floor in finitely
  many rejections -- at which point ``minimize_newton_cg`` returns the
  ``TrustCollapsed`` error instead of reporting convergence it does not
  have.

- ``rejection_propagates``: with a positive predicted reduction, a step
  that failed to lower the objective has rho <= 0 < eta and cannot be
  accepted. The acceptance test cannot be talked into an uphill step
  by a large denominator.

2 Steihaug-Toint: conjugate gradients under a leash
---------------------------------------------------

For large ``n`` the dense subproblem solve is the whole bill, so the
matrix-free path never forms ``H``: it runs conjugate gradients on
H p = -g, spending one Hessian action per iteration, and stops early
on any of three events.

1. Small residual: the inexact-Newton forcing sequence
   rtol = min(sqrt(||g||), 1/2) keeps early outer iterations cheap and
   the tail superlinear (Nocedal-Wright eq. 7.3).

2. Negative curvature: if d . H d <= 0 the model is unbounded along
   ``d``, and the right amount of greed is to walk the ray to the trust
   boundary. ``Rgmin.ray_further_is_lower`` in
   `Steihaug.lean <../../../proofs/lean/Rgmin/Steihaug.lean>`_
   proves the model is nonincreasing along such a ray, so the boundary
   point minimizes the model on it.

3. Boundary crossing: if the next iterate would leave the region, the
   code solves for the exact crossing.

The crossing length ``tau`` is the positive root of

dd tau\ :sup:`2`\ + 2 zd tau + (zz - r\ :sup:`2`\) = 0,

where zz, zd, dd are the tracked inner products of the current iterate
and direction. With the discriminant named as a square
(s\ :sup:`2`\ = zd\ :sup:`2`\ + dd (r\ :sup:`2`\ - zz)), two exact rational facts close the
construction, both in ``Steihaug.lean``:

- ``boundary_on_sphere``: the root lands exactly on the sphere,

  .. table::

  tracked -- the same algebra serves the Euclidean and preconditioned
  runs.

- ``boundary_tau_nonneg``: inside the region the root is nonnegative;
  a boundary exit extends the step, never retracts it.

The Rust test ``negative_curvature_walks_to_the_trust_boundary`` pins
the implemented step to the sphere at 1e-10 on an indefinite model.

3 The metric bookkeeping under a preconditioner
-----------------------------------------------

``steihaug_pcg`` runs the same loop under a preconditioner ``M``, and the
trust boundary lives in the M-norm. The Conn-Gould-Toint recurrences
track p.Mp, p.Md, d.Md from quantities already on hand (with M z = r,
every needed product reduces to Euclidean dots), so norms cost no
extra applications of ``M``. ``Rgmin.metric_update_scales`` in
`Precond.lean <../../../proofs/lean/Rgmin/Precond.lean>`_ pins the
linearity that makes the tracked comparison scale-consistent, and the
Rust test ``the_preconditioned_boundary_lives_in_the_sketch_metric``
holds the identity-preconditioner run bit-equal to the plain one.

4 Dogleg, for when the Hessian is cheap
---------------------------------------

When a dense Hessian is affordable (``HessianObjective``), the dogleg
path (``dogleg_direction``) interpolates between the Cauchy point (the
model minimizer along -g) and the Newton point, taking whichever the
radius allows. It is the classical picture the Steihaug path
generalizes: CG's first iterate is the Cauchy step, its limit is the
Newton step, and truncation by the boundary lands in between.
